## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar, created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), 
of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be 
solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. 
People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), 
[interview prep](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/), 
[company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), 
[university coursework](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home), 
[practice problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), or to 
[challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little [programming knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/)
and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; 
every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
